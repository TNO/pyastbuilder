Build 2676
- removed unnecessary import from grammar_functest

Build 2665
- added ParseStruct class method getPattern(), instance method __getPattern() now goes through getPattern()

Build 2647
- Added check hasParentPointers() to base.py
- Small changes to updateWith() and createParentPointers() in base.py, no functional change

Build 2620
- fixed a problem where IRIREF nodes upon expansion lost their parent and ancestors

Build 2490
- parsertools again prints version and build information when run

Build 2284
- SPARQLParser: fixed prefix expansion where prefix equal to ":"
- SPARQLParser: changed default value of parameter "base" for parseQuery() from "''" to "None"; adapted func_unittest.py accordingly
- adapted a few SPARQLParser tests with non-absolute IRI expansions: these are now called with "postParseCheck=False" to avoid irrelevant assertion failures
- Moved prefix checking in module sparqlparser from method _checkIriExpansion() to _applyPrefixesAndBase()
- Fixed a problem with base IRI processing (SPARQLParser). In the process:
	- removed parameter "isdefaultbase" from _applyPrefixesAndBase()
	- moved check on absolute iri for BASE declarations from _checkBaseDecls() into _applyPrefixesAndBase() (module sparqlparser)
	- removed _checkBaseDecls from this module
- Implemented grammar and unit tests for n3parser
- Moved sparqlparser tests to new folder tests/sparqlparser
- Created folder tests/n3parser
- Parser.addElement() now takes an optional parameter denoting the parent class of the element to be created

Version 0.2.6, Build 1757

- Bug fixed in getExpansion()
- Re-implemented _checkIriExpansion (without copy() operation)

Version 0.2.5, Build 1712

- The sparqlparser function expandIri() has been renamed to getExpansion(). Its signature has changed: it now gets called with a single iri/PrefixedName/IRIREF argument.
	This is normally expected to be an element of a complete parsed query, because it needs prefixes and a base iri for expansion to be possible.
	The function returns the string which is the expansion of its argument, in the local context of the element within the query. The element itself is NOT changed.
- Added optional parameter "postCheck" to the constructor of SPARQLStruct (when called with a string to parse). When False, post-processing checks are skipped. The
	default is True. This can be useful when constructing SPARQLStruct subelements by string argument, since prefixes and base iri might not be present.
- Added postprocessing method _checkParsedQuery to the constructor of SPARQLStruct (when called with a string to parse). This performs the following checks:
	- check BASE declarations for correctnets (= IRI must be absolute)
	- checks whether all IRIs (after prefix processing and base expansion) conform to RFC 3987
- Added _applyPrefixesAndBase method to SPARQLStruct: recursively attaches prefixes and base iri locally in force to subelements as _prefixes and _baseiri attributes
- Changed createParentPointers() to recursive form and moved it from parseStructFunc to ParseStruct.__init__()
- Changed signature of ParseStruct.__init__(): now always takes a string argument ("None" for bootstrapping by parseAction)
- Added checkBases() method to SPARQLStruct: tests all iris in BaseDecls for being absolute iris 
- Added checkIris() method to SPARQLStruct: tests all iris in IRIREFs and PrefixedNames for well-formedness according to rfc3987 (after prefix processing and expansion to absolute form)
- Added Unicode escape function "unescapeUcode()" to sparqlparser
- alltests now prints version and build numbers
- Moved version info out of parsertools.__init__.py to separate file
- Renamed ParseStruct "pattern" attribute to "_pattern" 
- Converted func_test to unittest format, renamed to func_unittest
- Cleaned up code and docstrings in base.py and sparqlparser.py
- Changed SPARQLStruct classmethod expandIri() to a sparqlparser module level function
- Added design_notes.txt
- Module extras.py exists no longer, functionality moved to base.py

Version 0.2.4

- Added SPARQLStruct instance method "expandIris()" to replace all iri elements with their expansion, taking into account the prefixes and base iri in force at the location of the iri
- Added SPARQLStruct classmethod "expandIri()" that takes 
	- a iri string (conforming to either a PrefixedName or a IRIREF pattern),
	- a dictionary of prefix-value mappings,
	- and a base iri
	and returns the iri string, expanded in the context defined by prefixes and base iri.
- Added a howto.txt with a short explanation how to use the framework.
	
Version 0.2.3

- Introduced SPARQLStruct as subclass of ParseStruct, holds additional SPARQL related info
- SPARQL parser now generates SPARQLStruct objects
- SPARQLStruct objects now contain "prefixes" and "baseiri" attributes that keep track of 
	the current prefixes dictionary and base iri value (accessable through getPrefixes() and getBaseiri() methods)

Version 0.2.2

- Labels added for BASE, PREFIX, WHERE, Update, Prologue and Constraint occurrences
- Improved patterns for NOT IN, NOT EXISTS, NIL and ANON, leading to better dump() output

Version 0.2.1

- Internal: code cleanup
- External: example.py extended

Version 0.2

Package now called parsertools.

The structure is as follows:
- parsertools.base: basic toolset, language independent
- parsertools.extras: utility functions for helping with specifying grammars. In this release: separatedList.
- parsertools.parsers: package containing parsers implemented. In this release SPARQL only.

A usage example is given in example.py.
